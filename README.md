#  Smart Waste Classification System

##  Project Overview

Rapid urbanization has led to a significant increase in municipal solid waste generation. Improper waste segregation at the source causes environmental pollution, inefficient recycling, and increased landfill usage.

This project presents an AI-powered Smart Waste Classification System that automatically identifies waste categories such as:

- Cardboard
- Glass
- Metal
- Paper
- Plastic
- Trash

The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on MobileNetV2 architecture and is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
